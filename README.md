Quantum Compression (Reliably Reconstructable Data Deconstruction)

This is an incredibly experimental algorithm using Torrent hashing and MEQUAVIS layers to deconstruct a file using classical computing in a way that is potentially reconstructable with quantum computers eventually. 

This project is currently an attempt to proof the theory by doing small scalle file reconstruction on the 8-bit and 16-bit level, with the intention of doing 32-bit and 64-bit reconstruction using cloud computing (distributed systems)

In it's current form this will not compress your files and can actually make them larger and it does not retain your data in a way that I can promise that it can be restored currently.

The intention is to get it to that point though and that can be hsown mathematically up to a certain bit level.

However with quantum computers that can do classical computations we could theoretically use this at absurdly high bit levels such as 2048 bit, which would yield incredible levels of compressions!

If this was worked out to it's full extent we could theoretically store the entire Earth's known data in a few gigabytes that a super computer could then inflate what it needs as it needs it.

This functionality would prove invaluable for space ships in the near future when a team may not have active live access to the internet for research and such. They could just inflate the archived internet they needed.

This is of course a long term and lofty goal.

Current algorithm makes a tiered layering of 8-bit and up torrent files that are then compressed into a single archive with a few extra files that record bit data for future inflation. This part is not completed as another layer of tracking is required.

This is a pet project or a side project. Not commercially available at this time or for any time in the foreseeable future.
